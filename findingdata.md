# Finding Data for the Humanities Classroom

This is a big topic, and I could write a book on it! I'll spare you the nitty-gritty details, though, and begin by just issuing a few pieces of advice.

First, there is no central humanities data repository. That's not to say that there aren't humanities data repositories -- [there are](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/datamanagement/dr_humanities) -- but to date, none of them has gathered enough momentum to be the obvious go-to place for data. So finding data for the humanities classroom is less like one-stop shopping and more like a treasure hunt.

Second, if you're working with students who are new to data manipulation and visualization, my recommendation is to hunt for data that's stored in the file format **CSV**.

CSV, or comma-separated value, files organize data in the rows-and-columns format that's familiar from spreadsheets. In fact, if you double-click a CSV file, it will generally open in Excel (or an equivalent, like Numbers). Think of CSVs as generic Excel files. There are many data formats in the world, including JSON, RDF, and SQL, and you may encounter them in your data travels. Unlike CSVs, however, these files don't automatically open in a legible-to-the-newcomer format like Excel. And you generally can't just drop them in a visualization tool; you need to work with them a bit first. So for first-timers, CSV is a great bridge between the baffling world of data and the comforting (or groan-inducing) familiarity of Excel.

Finally, expect students to panic a little on first being presented with a dataset. I think it's because the format is really unfamiliar. I like to ask them to open their dataset, panic a little, close it, take a deep breath, and acknowledge the panic. To mitigate the anxiety, we work through tutorials together, and I assure them that as long as they're hitting milestones, they're OK. I also really like to issue datasets with detailed "project briefs," so they don't feel quite so contextless. You can see how I do that [here](http://miriamposner.com/blog/data-packages-for-dh-beginners/). 

## On to places to find data!

I like to collect data, and rather than list it all here, I've [gathered it on my bookmarking site](https://pinboard.in/u:miriamposner/t:humdata/). In some cases, the data-collectors have shared data with me that's not publicly available on the web. I've denoted those cases and am happy to check with the creators about sharing, if you get in touch with me.

You can also have students build a dataset, either individually or collaboratively. This is a terrific way to get them thinking critically about categorization, archives, and authority. My students did this to build a [database of race films](http://dhbasecamp.humanities.ucla.edu/afamfilm/) and it provoked many wonderful discussions.

Alan Liu, at UC Santa Barbara, has [a wonderful collection](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244243/FrontPage) of data, tutorials, tools, and examples.

[Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive) is a great weekly newsletter that contains links to unusual and interesting datasets. You can view all of the datasets in [this spreadsheet](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/archive).

[The Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/) publishes peer-reviewed datasets. It's small, but growing. (If you've spent a long time collecting data, this could be a great way to make what you've done CV-able!)

Stanford offers a [list of repositories](http://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/share-and-preserve-research-data/domain-specific-data-repositori-1) that might contain useful data.

When cultural institutions publish data, they often post it to the versioning site Github, so it's worth searching Github if you're looking for data. For example, a search for "museum data" yields [many promising datasets](https://github.com/search?q=museum+data).
